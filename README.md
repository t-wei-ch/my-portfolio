## Projects (General Assembly)

### Capstone Project: An Overview of Japanese Natural Language Processing Tools through Unsupervised Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis of Hotel Reviews

I performed an aspect-based sentiment analysis on Japanese hotel reviews scraped from Rakuten Travel's Japanese page.

As processing of Japanese text differs greatly from that of the English language, different tools are needed, due to most tools available in Python for natural language processing being available only for English. This project explores some of the options, such as *natto-py* and *asari*.

### Optimizing Hospital Bed Occupancy Through Machine Learning

We developed a prediction model for the bed occupancy rates of NUH, based on publicly available data, so as to guide the efficient allocation of manpower and inventory for acute inpatient cases.

Several models were explored for this task, including a time series analysis (SARIMAX), and a LSTM network using TensorFlow, which turned out to be the most accurate in predicting bed occupancy rates for up to 3 months ahead.

### Millennials and Gen Z - How Differently Do They Speak?

We developed a classifier model for the two categories of Millennial and Gen Z in order for companies who advertise on Instagram to see the proportion of Millennials and Gen Zs who view engage with their advertisements, based on their comments.

Comments were scraped from the subreddits r/Millennials and r/GenZ as proxies for Instagram comments. A bag-of-words approached was then used to process the raw text data, followed by an exploration of several classifier models (e.g., Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) to see which performed best.

### HDB Resale Price Prediction and Analysis

We developed a regression model to predict the resale prices of HDB flats to within approximately 9% of the actual price, based on a dataset available on Kaggle.

This project involved a fair bit of feature selection and feature engineering, notably the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for the Singapore MRT network in order to find the minimal number of stations a HDB flat is from the Central Business District, and an implementation of the Haversine formula to compute distances between HDB flats and amenities, such as schools and malls.
